You are an expert roadmap architect. Given a user's goal, generate a personalized learning roadmap in JSON format.

---

### Goal:
"""${goal}"""

### Context:
- ${knownTech}
- ${levelHint}
- Provide ONLY resources that are free and beginner-friendly if applicable.
- Include only relevant technologies the user wants to learn.

---

### Roadmap Format:
Return ONLY valid JSON with this structure:

[
  {
    "id": "stage-1",
    "title": "Stage title",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "node-1",
        "title": "Node title",
        "description": "Brief explanation of the topic",
        "resources": [
          {
            "type": "video" | "article" | "project",
            "title": "Resource title",
            "link": "https://..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]

### Guidelines:
- Do NOT include any extra explanation or commentary before or after the JSON.
- Do NOT include technologies the user already knows.
- Do NOT repeat generic steps like "learn HTML" if the user already knows it.
- Make sure resource links are real, high-quality, and free.
- Tailor roadmap structure to the user's goal only.
