      question: "What exactly is a Rave Journey?",
      answer:
        "A Rave Journey is a personalized AI-powered roadmap designed to guide you through learning a new skill, subject, or achieving a specific goal. Each Journey includes customized milestones, curated resources, and recommended timelines based on your specific needs and preferences.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the AI create personalized roadmaps?",
      answer:
        "Our advanced AI analyzes your inputs including your current skill level, available time commitment, learning style preferences, and goals. It then draws from a vast database of educational resources, expert paths, and successful learning patterns to create a roadmap specifically tailored to you. The AI continuously improves as you provide feedback and track your progress.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize my Journey after it's created?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely! While the AI creates an initial roadmap, you have full control to modify any aspect of your Journey. You can adjust timelines, add or remove milestones, incorporate specific resources, or even merge multiple Journeys. The platform also allows you to track progress, make notes, and receive adaptive recommendations as you advance.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Rave suitable for teams or just individuals?",
      answer:
        "Rave works wonderfully for both individuals and teams. For teams, we offer collaborative Journeys where multiple members can follow the same roadmap, track collective progress, and share insights. Team leaders can monitor overall advancement, identify bottlenecks, and ensure everyone stays aligned with learning objectives. We also provide enterprise solutions with advanced analytics and custom integration options.",
